Deployment Notes:

1. Deploy as Root

    The code in this project was written to be deployed directly as the root of a Tomcat server.

    E.g. Instead of http://localhost:8080/IoTBay-1.0/index.jsp, it would be http://localhost:8080/index.jsp

    This is important to keep in mind as otherwise links will not work.

    Testing was completed on Apache Tomcat Version 10.1.4

2. MySQL Database

    This project is supported by a MySQL database running locally on the machine.

    Database dumps are located in src/main/db/. These can imported using MySQL Workbench to create a copy of our database.

    The code is written to connect to the database via JDBC as user: 'root', password: 'iotbay'

    User and pass details can be changed in the DBConnector.java and DBManagerTest.java files.
